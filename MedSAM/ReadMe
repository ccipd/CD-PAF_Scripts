Note: MedSam cannot only segment one structure at a time - hence make sure that the main.py file shows the specific structures you need so medsam can be called on each structure accordingly

To set up a virtual environment for MedSAM:
- Python version 3.10 only (THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT - PYTORCH NOT STABLE OTHERWISE)

How to do this on HPC:
>> module spider python
>> module load Python/3.10
>> python3.10 -m medSAM
>> source medSAM/bin/activate

Output are 4 .mha probability maps: labels [0,1,2,3] and a combined label image which is a multi-component image
